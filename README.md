# Asciipaint

## About the project

Ascii Paint is a console-based application that allows users to create, move, and manipulate different geometric shapes. The shapes (circle, rectangle, square, and line) can be displayed in an ASCII-based illustration. Users can interact with the application using text commands to add shapes, move them, change their color, and group or ungroup shapes. The application also supports undo and redo functionalities for better user control.
